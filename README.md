# Hybrid-forecasting-model-of-PM2.5
With the acceleration of urbanization leading to a general decrease in air quality, accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction is of utmost practical meaning for the control and prevention of air pollution in the region. Therefore, a new hybrid prediction model for PM2.5 concentration based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), approximate entropy (ApEn), variational mode decomposition optimized by capuchin search algorithm (CVMD), long short-term memory optimized by pelican optimization algorithm (POA-LSTM) and error correction (EC), named CEEMDAN-ApEn-CVMD-POA-LSTM-EC, is proposed.
